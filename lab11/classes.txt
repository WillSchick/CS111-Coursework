Question 11.1 In the Die class definition, how can you identify the class constructor?
	
	- Class constructors are always marked with "__init__(self)"


Question 11.2 Assuming the class has been imported into your program, give the statement to
create a Die object that is assigned to the variable myDie.
	
	- myDie = Die()


Question 11.3 Do the objects created from the class contain one or more instance variable(s)? If
so, give the name of the instance variable(s).
	
	- The Die class has the instance variable "_faceValue"


Question 11.4 Are Die objects mutable or immutable. If they are mutable, identify a method that
modifies an object.
	
	- Mutable, the roll method changes the "_faceValue" instance variable.


Question 11.5 Identify one accessor method and one mutator method in the Die class.

	- "getValue" method accesses the instance variable "_faceValue"
	- "roll" method mutates the instance variable "_faceValue"


Question 11.6 Identify one local variable (other than self) used in the Die class.

	- "newValue" is used inside the "roll" method


Question 11.7 Suppose you wanted to add another method called reset that sets the die back to
the value 1. What would that method look like? [Do not actually add this method to the class]

	"
	def reset(self):
		self._faceValue = 1	
	"
